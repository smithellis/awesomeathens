What Is This
===

**AwesomeAthens.com** is a cool little one page site.  The idea is that it showcases the town of Athens, GA.

AwesomeAthens is intended to be a site that helps attact talent and businesses
to Athens, GA.  It's an awesome town.

I didn't do much to it, so don't I'm cool.  I got a template from [Blacktie.co](http://BlackTie.co) and modified it.  Found a cool video.  Etc.
